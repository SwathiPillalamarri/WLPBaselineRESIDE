# WLPBaselineRESIDE
Repository for creating training/testing datasets based on Wet Lab Protocols, to be used for training RESIDE in separate repo.

To create Wet Lab Protocol training/testing data, run their respective python files: `trainprotocols_raw.py` , `testprotocols_raw.py`. These will output the `wlp_test.json` and `wlp_train.json` files to be used as the data in the RESIDE model in the forked RESIDE repo in `SwathiPillalamarri/RESIDE/data`.
