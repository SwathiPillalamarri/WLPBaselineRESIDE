# WLPBaselineRESIDE
Repository for training RESIDE on Wet Lab Protocols

To create Wet Lab Protocol training/testing data, run their respective python files: `trainprotocols_raw.py` , `testprotocols_raw.py`. These will output the `wlp_test.json` and `wlp_train.json` files to be used as the data in the RESIDE model in the forked RESIDE repo in `SwathiPillalamarri/RESIDE/data`.
